# GettingCleaningDataCourseProject

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This project will get and clean data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphoneOne.  One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article:  http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/  Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

For this project, a R script called run_analysis.R will be created that does the following. 
1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The run_analysis.R file is created in RStudio in Windows platform and can be run with RStudio.  The CodeBook.md file is the code book for this project which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that will be performed to clean up the data.
